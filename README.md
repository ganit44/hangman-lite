# hangman-lite

This repository contains simple CLI Hangman Game.

I wrote this simple game to be able to push it to [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository).
It was written mainly to understand [PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD) echosystem. 

Repository can be found here [AUR LINK](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hangman-lite/).

PKGBUILD file can be found in this git repo or above AUR link.

`makepkg -si` will install the game.

It can then be started from terminal using command `hangman`.
